My areas of interest broadly cover network inference, probabilistic graphical models, computational statistics, and causal inference. I mainly work on developing methods using principles from these areas for analysing large scale perturbation screens data. 

### Pathway reconstruction exploting off-target effects

Pathway reconstruction has proven to be an indispensable tool for analyzing the underlying molecular mechanisms of a cell. There are existing probabilistic graphical models, which have been designed to reconstruct pathways from high dimensional observations resulting from RNA interference (RNAi) experiments. These models assume that the short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) designed to knockdown specific genes are always on-target. However, in reality most siRNAs exhibit strong off-target effects, which further confound the RNAi screen data, thus resulting in unreliable reconstruction of networks. We developed a method called probabilistic combinatorial nested effects model (pc-nem) to use this combinatorial knockdown data as a result of siRNA off-target effects to accurately infer the underlying pathway.
