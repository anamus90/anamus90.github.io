  I recently moved to the bay area after defending my doctoral thesis in the <a href="https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cbg" style="color: #2E2D2D; text-decoration: underline;">computational biology group</a> at ETHZ, Basel. I worked on developing statistical and computational methods for discerning genetic interactions from large scale perturbation screens. My research interests lie at the intersection of casual inference, personalised healthcare, and more recently in health policy.

  Besides my academic life, I am an avid traveller, a movie buff, and enjoy the outdoors. I also enjoy reading, painting, and quizzing.
