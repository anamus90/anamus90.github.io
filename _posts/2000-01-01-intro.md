  I am currently a fourth year graduate student in the <a href="https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cbg" style="color: #2E2D2D; text-decoration: underline;">computational biology group</a> at ETHZ, Basel. I work on developing statistical and computational methods for discerning genetic interactions from large scale perturbation screens. I am particularly interested in probabilistic graphical models and causality. For more information, check out my <a href="https://github.com/anamus90/anamus90.github.io/supp_files/SS_CV_2019.pdf" style="color: #2E2D2D; text-decoration: underline;">CV</a>.

  Besides my academic life, I am an avid traveller, a movie buff, and enjoy the outdoors. I also enjoy reading, painting, and quizzing.
