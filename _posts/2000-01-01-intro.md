I am currently a third year graduate student in the <a href="https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cbg" style="color: #2E2D2D; text-decoration: underline;"> computational biology group</a> at ETHZ, Basel. I work on developing statistical and computational methods for analysing high throughput perturbation screens. I am particularly interested in probabilistic graphical models and causality. 

Beyond my PhD life, I am an avid traveller, a movie buff, and enjoy the outdoors. I also enjoy reading, painting, and quizzing.
